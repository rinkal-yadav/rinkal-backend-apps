            about: "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was in the hot seat on Tuesday, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in his renomination hearing. Coming just one day ahead of a Consumer Price Index reading that is expected to show a sky-high 7 percent annualized inflation rate, the hearing was dominated by the topic of fast-rising prices and how the Fed plans to respond. Powell indicated a willingness to raise interest rates and unwind other pandemic-era economic support programs as the central bank contends with rising inflation, but noted that rising wages at the bottom of the income spectrum are not currently a contributing factor. After spending much of 2021 characterizing steadily building inflation as “transitory” — triggered by supply chain bottlenecks rather than more fundamental drivers — the Fed shifted its stance over the last few months and indicated a future trajectory that backs out much of the pandemic-era policy support it put into place to prevent a financial meltdown in March 2020. Powell acknowledged the unprecedented nature of both the economic shock dealt by the pandemic as well as the uncharted path of the recovery. “Monetary policy must take a broad and forward-looking view, keeping pace with an ever-evolving economy,” he said. In keeping monetary policy accommodative for close to two years after the Covid-19 pandemic hit American shores, Powell and other Fed officials had made the argument that it was necessary to keep rates low and backstop bond markets until the labor market recovered from its swoon.

            about: "The rise of remote work, in what some labor experts are calling “the largest change in American working and living conditions since World War II,” is set to accelerate and become a more permanent fixture as of 2022, industry observers say. The latest jobs report, released Friday, revealed a still-volatile labor market with payrolls gaining just 199,000 for the month of December, down from November's 249,000 and missing expectations of 422,000. It was a fizzling cap to a year when millions of workers voluntarily left their job each month. Full return to office is 'dead,' experts say — and remote is only growing. The change in attitudes can be charted in the survey he's been conducting of employers about their planned number of work-from-home days “post-Covid.” From June 2020 to November 2021, the number of days has steadily increased, from 1.4 days per week to more than 2 days. Firms have become increasingly positive on work from home as the pandemic has dragged on. They have adapted their management, organization and IT to operate more effectively with work from home employees,” Bloom said. “Additional return-to-office delays are likely to further increase long-run work from home levels."

The increase of 370,000 people who quit, which was reported Tuesday in the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, was led by the accommodation and food services industry. There were also big increases in the health care and social assistance fields, as well as the transportation, warehousing and utilities sectors. All four U.S. regions reported rises in the number of people quitting their jobs. The historic rates of quitting continued through the end of 2021, said Nick Bunker, the director of research at the job services company Indeed Hiring Lab. Workers continued to switch jobs in light of the many opportunities the current labor market provides, with the private-sector quits rate hitting an all-time high of 3.4 percent. Of course, whether these conditions continue into 2022 is one of the biggest questions for the year ahead."

As a first-time offender, Holmes is unlikely to face the full term. She could also be fined and required to pay restitution to her former investors. Of the 11 charges, Holmes was acquitted on all that related to defrauding patients and one count of conspiracy. The jury remained deadlocked on three counts of defrauding investors. The underlying wire fraud amounts on those counts ranged from $99 thousand to $5.3 million. In total, Holmes was found guilty of defrauding investors of nearly $145 million. The underlying wire fraud amounts for those charges ranged from $38 million for PFM Healthcare Master Fund, a San-Francisco based healthcare hedge fund, to almost $100 million for Lakeshore Capital Management, a fund connected to the DeVos family office."

The bank said the duplicate payments were caused by a “scheduling issue” that has now been rectified. It is now trying to recuperate the mistaken payments, many of which have gone into bank accounts operated by rival banks. We're sorry that due to a technical issue, some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients accounts, a Santander spokesperson told CNBC. None of our clients were at any point left out of pocket as a result and we will be working hard with many banks across the UK to recover the duplicated transactions over the coming days."

Schneider, a senior vice president for policy and research at The Commonwealth Fund who collaborated on the model. “We could have had even greater impact if we had more people vaccinated.” Even without reaching higher vaccination levels, the vaccines decreased the impact of the alpha variant, a moderately more contagious form of the virus that was first detected in the United Kingdom and began circulating worldwide by the end of 2020. It became the dominant variant in the U.S. in April 2021.

All of them advised vaccinated people to remain vigilant and conscientious — and not to return fully to pre-pandemic life — but there was no firm consensus around some activities like air travel. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, struck the most cautious note, saying he has avoided travel and restaurant dining since March 2020."

The result allowed Owen Coyle's men to leapfrog the competition and reach first place in the points table with 19 points. The early exchanges saw both teams create half chances as there was little to separate the teams. Arindam Bhattacharja was called into action in the 27th minute after Murray found space behind the defensive line. The goalkeeper did well to leave the box and make the clearance. No major scoring chances fell to either team until the half-hour mark."

            about:"North Korea appeared to test fire a ballistic missile on Tuesday for the second time in less than a week, drawing condemnation from South Korea and Japan where officials said the repeated launches risked destabilising the region. The suspected ballistic missile launch was detected around 7:27 a.m. (2227 GMT) from an inland area of North Korea toward the ocean off its east coast, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement. South Korea's National Security Council held an emergency meeting and expressed “strong regret” that the missile test came at a time when regional stability is extremely important. “Members of the NSC urged North Korea to swiftly respond to the international community's expectations for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, and agree to resume dialogue and cooperation,” the presidential Blue House said in a statement. Coming after nuclear-armed North Korea claimed to have tested a hypersonic missile on Wednesday, the launch underscored leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's vow to bolster the military at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled. Japan's defence ministry said that if the projectile followed a normal trajectory for ballistic missiles it would have flown less than 700 km (435 miles), similar to recent tests of short-range ballistic missiles by North Korea. The South Korean military said it was cooperating with its U.S. allies and closely monitoring the situation in preparation for additional launches."

After nearly 50 years of business, the treasured East Village store is shutting down. Following nearly two years of pandemic-related struggles, combined with a landlord dispute, the loss of her husband and her own health problems, Saroj Goyal, the owner, decided that closing the store was the best choice. “Every moment is special here,” said Goyal, 72, as she sat sipping hot tea on a December afternoon. Every so often, she paused the conversation to help a customer who had wandered in, sharing suggestions and telling them to check out the shop's Instagram. Goyal and her husband, Purushottam Goyal, emigrated from Delhi, India, in the 1970s. It was his idea to open the business in 1977; the shop soon became a slice of South Asia in Manhattan. For decades, the couple would travel to India to find one-of-a-kind objects to sell. “My husband walked from village to village to collect all these things. He had a very unique taste,” Saroj Goyal said, picking up a hand-beaded textile."

The lockdown of Anyang, home to 5.5 million people, was announced late Monday after two cases of the omicron variant were reported. Residents are not allowed to go out and stores have been ordered shut except those selling necessities. Another 13 million people have been locked down in Xi'an for nearly three weeks, and 1.1 million more in Yuzhou for more than a week. It wasn't clear how long the lockdown of Anyang would last, as it was announced as a measure to facilitate mass testing of residents, which is standard procedure in China's strategy of identifying and isolating infected people as quickly as possible. The lockdowns are the broadest since the shutting down of Wuhan and most of the rest of Hubei province in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Since then, China's approach has evolved into one of targeting smaller areas hit by outbreaks for lockdowns. The approach of the Winter Olympics, which open Feb. 4 in Beijing, and the emergence of omicron have brought back citywide lockdowns in a bid to snuff out outbreaks and prevent them from spreading to other parts of China. A Beijing Olympics official responsible for disease control, Huang Chun, said organizers are counting on the cooperation of athletes and officials to prevent an outbreak that could affect participation."

US officials had expected additional Russian troops to stream toward the Ukrainian border in December and early January, building toward a force of 175,000. While troop movements have slowed, there are still 1,00,000 military personnel near the border and now the Russians have positioned additional attack aircraft there, US officials said. Attack and transport helicopters, along with ground attack fighter jets, would be a critical Russian advantage, should Putin decide to invade Ukraine. US officials say the Russian president's window for an invasion is limited, dictated by temperatures that will freeze the ground — allowing for the easy movement of heavy vehicles and equipment — before a spring thaw, which could begin by March, creates a muddy quagmire."
